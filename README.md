## Bekir Afsar, PhD

I'm a data scientist focused on data-driven decision support, multiobjective optimization, and explainable AI. My work combines advanced computational modeling with real-world decision needs in domains such as forestry, sustainability, and manufacturing.

**Lead Use Case:** Forest Biodiversity Digital Twin (EU BioDT)  
**Open Source:** Contributor to DESDEO â€“ interactive decision support framework  
**Recognition:** Google Prize for Outstanding Paper (IEEE CITREx 2025)
